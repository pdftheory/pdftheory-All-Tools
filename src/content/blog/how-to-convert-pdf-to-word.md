## How to convert PDF to Word

Use the free [PDF to Word](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-docx) tool to unlock your document's content.

1. Go to the [PDF to Word](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-docx) tool.
2. Upload the PDF file you want to convert.
3. Click **Convert**.
4. Download your editable Word document.

Open the file in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or any other word processor, and start editing.

## Does it keep the formatting?

Yes. The conversion tool does its best to maintain:

- Fonts and text styles
- Paragraphs and line spacing
- Images and graphics placement
- Tables and lists

Ideally, your new Word document will look almost identical to the original PDF, just editable.

## Handling scanned PDFs

If your PDF is a scan (an image of a document), a standard conversion might result in images pasted into Word — not editable text.

To fix this, you need OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

1. First, run your scanned PDF through our [OCR tool](/en/tools/ocr-pdf) to recognize the text.
2. Download the searchable PDF.
3. Then, convert that new PDF to Word using the [PDF to Word](/en/tools/pdf-to-docx) tool.

Now you have actual text you can edit, copy, and format.

## Real-world ways people use PDF to Word

### Students: repurpose research material

Found a great PDF article but need to pull quotes and citations? Convert it to Word to easily copy-paste text without formatting issues.

### HR Managers: update old forms

Need to update an employee handbook or policy document but only have the PDF version? Convert to Word, make your changes, and save it as a fresh PDF.

### Legal professionals: edit contracts

Received a draft contract as a PDF? Convert it to Word to use "Track Changes" and propose edits directly in the document.

## Tips for better results

### Use standard fonts

Files with standard fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica) convert most accurately. If your PDF uses very obscure custom fonts, Word might substitute them with something similar.

### Keep layouts simple

Complex brochures with heavy layering might need some manual adjustment in Word after conversion. Standard documents, letters, and reports usually convert perfectly.

### Check your file size

Large PDFs with many high-res images can result in large Word files. Consider [compressing your PDF](/en/tools/compress-pdf) before converting if size is a concern.
