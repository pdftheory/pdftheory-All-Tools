We've all been there: you try to email a PDF report and get the "file too large" error. Or you try to upload a document to a government or school portal, and it rejects your file because it's 2MB over the limit.

High-quality PDFs with images and scans can get huge quickly. But you don't have to delete pages or redo your work. Compressing the file reduces its size significantly — often by 50% or more — while keeping it looking sharp.

Here's how to shrink your PDFs for free with PDFTheory.

## How to compress a PDF

Use the free [Compress PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/compress-pdf) tool to optimize your file size.

1. Go to the [Compress PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/compress-pdf) tool.
2. Upload the large PDF file.
3. Choose your compression level (if available) or let the tool automatically optimize it.
4. Click **Compress**.
5. Download your smaller, lighter PDF file.

You'll see exactly how much space you saved — often reducing a 10MB file down to 2MB or less.

## Why are some PDFs so big?

Usually, it's the images. High-resolution photos, scanned pages, and unoptimized graphics take up a lot of space.

PDF compression works by:

- Reducing the resolution of images slightly (to a level that still looks great on screens).
- Removing unnecessary metadata and hidden data.
- optimizing fonts and structure.

For text-only documents, compression might be minimal. But for anything with images or scans, the results are drastic.

## Real-world ways people use compression

### Students: Submit assignments easily

Course portals often have strict upload limits (like 5MB). Don't panic if your scanned homework is 20MB — just compress it. It will still look legible, but the file size will drop enough to upload.

### Professionals: Send email attachments

Most email providers limit attachments to 20MB or 25MB. If you're sending a presentation or portfolio, compressing it ensures it lands in your client's inbox instead of bouncing back.

### Web developers: Faster loading times

Hosting PDF brochures or menus on your website? A smaller file loads faster for your visitors, especially on mobile phones. Always compress before you upload.

## Tips for better compression

### Don't overdo it

Extreme compression can make images look blurry. PDFTheory finds the sweet spot — small enough to share, but clear enough to read and print.

### Compress scans properly

If you scanned a document at a very high DPI (like 600 DPI), it's going to be huge. Compressing it down to 150 DPI makes it perfect for sharing while remaining readable.

### Check the quality

Always open your compressed PDF and give it a quick look before sending. Ensure charts and small text are still crisp.
