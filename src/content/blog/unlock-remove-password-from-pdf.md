You know the password to your own PDF, but typing it every time you open the file is getting old. Or maybe a colleague sent you a password-protected report and you need to copy some text, but the permissions won't let you. It's your file, you have the right access — you just want the password gone.

Removing a password from a PDF is quick and straightforward when you have the right tool. Here's how.

## How to unlock a PDF

Use the free [Unlock PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/unlock-pdf) tool to remove password protection from your files.

1. Go to the [Unlock PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/unlock-pdf) tool.
2. Upload the password-protected PDF.
3. Enter the password when prompted (you need to know the password to remove it).
4. Click **Unlock**.
5. Download your unlocked PDF — now open and usable without any password.

That's all it takes. The file is now fully accessible for editing, printing, and sharing.

## Understanding PDF password types

Not all PDF passwords work the same way. There are two types, and it helps to know the difference:

**Open password (user password)** — this blocks anyone from even opening the file. You need to enter the password before the PDF will display. To remove this password, you must know it first.

**Permissions password (owner password)** — this allows the file to be opened but restricts certain actions like printing, copying text, or editing. You might be able to view the file but can't do much with it.

PDFTheory's Unlock tool handles both types. If you know the password, you can remove all restrictions in one step.

## Real-world ways people unlock PDFs

### Professionals: Remove outdated protection

You set a password on a confidential report six months ago, and now it needs to be widely shared within your team. Instead of resending with a new unlocked version from the original software, just remove the password and distribute the PDF as-is.

### Students: Copy text for notes and citations

Received a password-protected academic paper or course material? If you have authorized access, unlock it so you can highlight, copy, and paste text into your notes — much more efficient than retyping.

### Small business owners: Print and file contracts

You received a signed PDF contract with print restrictions. Now you need a hard copy for your records. Unlock the permissions so you can print it without any issues.

## Tips for working with PDF security

### Add a password when you need one

After unlocking, if you want to re-protect the file with a different password, use the [Protect PDF](/en/tools/protect-pdf) tool. This is useful when you need to update the password or apply different permission settings.

### Adjust permissions without removing the password

Sometimes you don't want to fully unlock a file — you just want to change what's allowed (printing, editing, copying). The [Change Permissions](/en/tools/change-permissions) tool lets you fine-tune these settings.

### Keep your files secure

PDF passwords are a great way to protect sensitive documents. Read our post on [keeping PDFs safe](/en/blog/are-pdfs-safe-to-open) for more tips on document security.
