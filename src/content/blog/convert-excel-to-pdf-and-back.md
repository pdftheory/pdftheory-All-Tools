## How to convert Excel to PDF

Use the free [Excel to PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/excel-to-pdf) tool to turn your spreadsheet into a clean, shareable PDF.

1. Go to the [Excel to PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/excel-to-pdf) tool.
2. Upload your Excel file (.xlsx or .xls).
3. Click **Convert**.
4. Download your PDF — ready to share, print, or archive.

The conversion preserves your column widths, cell formatting, borders, and colors. What you see in Excel is what you get in the PDF.

## How to convert PDF to Excel

Need to go the other way? Use the [PDF to Excel](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-xlsx) tool to extract data from PDF tables into an editable spreadsheet.

1. Go to the [PDF to Excel](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-xlsx) tool.
2. Upload the PDF containing your tables or data.
3. Click **Convert**.
4. Download the Excel file and start working with your data.

This is especially useful for invoices, bank statements, and reports that you've received as PDFs but need to analyze or modify.

## Real-world ways people use these tools

### Accountants: Share reports confidently

Convert your Excel reports to PDF before sending them to clients or management. The layout stays exactly as you designed it, formulas are hidden, and nobody can accidentally change any numbers.

### Students: Submit clean assignments

Many courses require submissions in PDF format. If you've built a data analysis project in Excel, converting to PDF gives you a polished, printable document that looks professional.

### Small business owners: Digitize invoices

Received a PDF invoice from a supplier and need to log it in your accounting spreadsheet? Convert the PDF to Excel, copy the relevant data, and keep your records up to date without manual typing.

## Tips for better results

### Keep your Excel formatting simple

Complex formatting — like merged cells, layered charts, and conditional formatting — may not always translate perfectly to PDF. If the resulting PDF doesn't look quite right, simplify the layout slightly and convert again.

### Handle scanned PDFs with OCR

If your PDF is a scanned image (not selectable text), the PDF to Excel tool may need help recognizing the content. Run [OCR](/en/tools/ocr-pdf) on the file first to make the text recognizable, then convert to Excel.

### Compress large files after converting

High-resolution Excel files with lots of images and charts can produce large PDFs. Use the [Compress PDF](/en/tools/compress-pdf) tool to bring the file size down for easy sharing.
