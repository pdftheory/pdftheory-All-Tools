You receive an email from an unknown sender with a PDF attachment titled "Invoice" or "Urgent Report." Your first instinct might be to click it — after all, it's just a PDF, right? Unlike `.exe` files, PDFs are generally seen as harmless documents.

But can a PDF file actually contain a virus? The short answer is: **yes, it can.**

While most PDFs are perfectly safe, malicious files do exist. Here is everything you need to know about PDF safety and how to protect yourself.

> ## Key Takeaways
> 
> - PDFs can contain malicious scripts (JavaScript) or links that compromise your device.
> - Most PDF readers have security features to block these threats — keep yours updated.
> - Never download or open PDFs from suspicious emails or unknown sources.
> - Use online tools like PDFTheory to view files safely in your browser (sandboxed).
> - Disable JavaScript in your PDF reader settings for maximum security.

## How can a PDF be dangerous?

A standard PDF is just a container for text and images. However, the PDF format supports advanced features that hackers can exploit:

### 1. Malicious Scripts

PDFs can contain embedded JavaScript. Attackers write scripts that execute when you open the file, potentially downloading malware or exploiting vulnerabilities in your PDF reader.

### 2. Phishing Links

A PDF might look like a legitimate invoice from your bank or Amazon. It contains a link saying "Click here to pay" or "Verify your account." Clicking it takes you to a fake website designed to steal your login credentials.

### 3. Exploits

If you use an outdated PDF reader (like an old version of Adobe Reader), a malicious file can exploit unpatched security holes to take control of your system.

## How to spot a malicious PDF

Be suspicious if:

- **Unexpected email:** You weren't expecting an invoice or report from this sender.
- **Generic greeting:** The email says "Dear Customer" instead of your name.
- **Urgency:** The message demands immediate action ("Overdue Payment!", "Account Suspended!").
- **Weird file name:** The PDF has a random name like `invoice_8374_scan.pdf` or double extensions like `document.pdf.exe`.

## How to open PDFs safely

### 1. Use a browser-based viewer

Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) have built-in PDF viewers that run in a "sandbox." This means even if the PDF has malicious code, it's isolated from your computer's system files. Opening a PDF in Chrome is generally safer than opening it in a desktop app.

### 2. Keep your software updated

Whether you use Adobe Acrobat, Foxit, or your browser, always install the latest updates. Examples of PDF exploits are almost always fixed in newer versions.

### 3. Disable JavaScript

For maximum safety, turn off JavaScript in your PDF reader's preferences.

- **In Adobe Reader:** Go to *Edit > Preferences > JavaScript* and uncheck "Enable Acrobat JavaScript."
- **In Chrome/Edge:** JavaScript is usually disabled by default for PDFs, or heavily restricted.

### 4. Analyze suspicious files

If you're unsure about a file, don't open it. Upload it to a tool like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) to scan it with dozens of antivirus engines.

## Can PDFTheory help?

Yes. When you use PDFTheory's tools (like [View PDF](/en/tools/view-pdf) or [Convert PDF](/en/tools/pdf-to-word)), the file is processed in a secure environment. We strip away non-essential elements during processing, which often neutralizes malicious scripts.

However, we always recommend scanning suspicious files with an antivirus before uploading them anywhere.

## FAQs

> **FAQ: Can I get a virus just by previewing a PDF?**
>
> It's rare, but possible if your PDF reader has a critical vulnerability. In most modern systems, unauthorized code execution is blocked.




> **FAQ: Are password-protected PDFs safer?**
>
> Not necessarily. A malicious PDF can be password-protected to bypass email virus scanners (since the scanner can't read the encrypted content). Be extra careful with password-protected files from strangers.




> **FAQ: Is it safe to open PDFs on my phone?**
>
> Generally, yes. Mobile operating systems (iOS and Android) are very restrictive about what apps can do. A malicious PDF is less likely to cause system-wide damage on a phone than on a Windows PC.




> **FAQ: What should I do if I opened a suspicious PDF?**
>
> If you clicked a link, close the page immediately and change your passwords. If the file behaved strangely (opened and closed quickly, or asked for admin permissions), run a full antivirus scan on your computer.




> **FAQ: Are scanned PDFs safer?**
>
> Yes. A purely scanned PDF is just a collection of images. It generally doesn't contain executable code or scripts, making it much safer than a digitally created PDF with interactive elements.




## Final thoughts

PDFs are a part of daily digital life, and you shouldn't be afraid to use them. Just like with email attachments or websites, a little caution goes a long way. Keep your software updated, don't click on strange links, and when in doubt — inspect it before you open it.
