1. Go to the [JPG to PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/jpg-to-pdf) tool.
2. Upload one or more JPG images — drag and drop them, or click to browse your files.
3. Arrange the images in the order you want them to appear in the PDF.
4. Adjust settings like page size and orientation if needed.
5. Click **Convert**.
6. Download your new PDF file.

Each image becomes its own page in the final document. Simple as that.

## Working with mixed image formats

Have a mix of JPG, PNG, and other image types? No problem. The [Image to PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/image-to-pdf) tool accepts all common image formats and combines them into a single PDF. You don't need to convert anything beforehand — just upload and go.

## Real-world ways people use JPG to PDF

### Students: Submit assignments as PDFs

Many schools and universities require assignments in PDF format. If you've handwritten your work and taken photos, converting those images to PDF makes submission easy and looks more professional.

### Professionals: Digitize signed documents

Took a photo of a signed contract, approval form, or ID? Convert the images to a PDF so they're easy to email, file, and archive — all in a standard format that anyone can open.

### Small business owners: Organize receipts and invoices

Instead of keeping loose JPG files of receipts scattered across your phone, bundle them into monthly PDF files. It makes bookkeeping and tax time a lot less stressful.

## Tips for better results

### Use good lighting when photographing documents

The quality of your conversion depends on the quality of your original image. Make sure there's enough light, avoid shadows, and keep the camera steady for sharp results.

### Arrange before you convert

Take a moment to put your images in the right order before hitting convert. It's easier than rearranging pages after the fact — though you can always use the [Organize PDF](/en/tools/organize-pdf) tool to reorder pages later.

### Compress if the file is too large

If your JPG images are high-resolution, the resulting PDF might be larger than expected. Use the [Compress PDF](/en/tools/compress-pdf) tool to bring the file size down without losing noticeable quality. Check out our [guide to compressing PDFs](/en/blog/how-to-compress-pdf-files) for more tips.
