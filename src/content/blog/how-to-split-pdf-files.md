## How to split a PDF with PDFTheory

Use the free [Split PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/split-pdf) tool to divide your document in seconds.

1. Go to the [Split PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/split-pdf) tool.
2. Upload the PDF you want to split — drag and drop it, or click to browse your files.
3. Choose how you'd like to split: by page range, into equal parts, or one page per file.
4. Click **Split**.
5. Download your split files individually or as a ZIP archive.

That's it — your original file stays untouched, and you get exactly the pages you need.

## Extract specific pages instead

Sometimes you don't need to split a file into multiple parts. You just want a few specific pages pulled out. The [Extract Pages](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/extract-pages) tool is perfect for this.

Upload your PDF, select the pages you want (even non-consecutive ones like pages 2, 7, and 15), and download a clean new file with only those pages.

This is especially handy when you're preparing documents for a meeting, pulling receipts from a financial report, or isolating a single form from a packet.

## Real-world ways people use PDF splitting

### Students: Focus on what matters

Instead of scrolling through an entire textbook PDF, split out the chapters you're studying this week. It makes note-taking easier and keeps your files lightweight.

### Professionals: Share only what's relevant

Need to send a contract section to a client for review? Split the document so they see only the relevant clauses — no more, no less. It keeps things clean and confidential.

### Small business owners: Stay organized

Break long invoices, catalogs, or manuals into separate files by month, department, or product line. Easier to file, easier to find later.

## Tips for better results

### Clean up first

Before splitting, consider removing any [blank pages](/en/tools/remove-blank-pages) from your document. This ensures your split files don't contain unnecessary empty pages.

### Add page numbers after splitting

Once you've split a document, the original page numbers may not match up anymore. Use the [Page Numbers](/en/tools/page-numbers) tool to add fresh numbering to each file.

### Recombine if needed

Changed your mind about how the pages are organized? Use the [Merge PDF](/en/tools/merge-pdf) tool to join files back together in any order you like. You can also check out our guide on [how to merge PDF files online](/en/blog/how-to-merge-pdf-files-online) for a step-by-step walkthrough.
