You have three different PDF files: a cover letter, a resume, and a portfolio. Sending them as separate attachments looks messy and risks one getting lost. Or maybe you have ten different invoices that you need to submit as a single expense report.

Merging your PDFs into one file is the professional solution. It keeps your documents organized and makes life easier for everyone. Here's how to do it quickly and for free.

## How to merge PDF files

Use the free [Merge PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/merge-pdf) tool to combine your documents in seconds.

1. Go to the [Merge PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/merge-pdf) tool.
2. Upload the files you want to combine — select as many as you need.
3. Drag and drop the thumbnails to arrange them in the correct order.
4. Click **Merge**.
5. Download your single, combined PDF file.

It's that simple. Your new file is ready to share, email, or save.

## Real-world ways people use PDF merging

### Job seekers: Create a single application packet

Don't make recruiters open three different files. Merge your cover letter, resume, and references into one professional PDF document.

### Students: Assemble group projects

Everyone wrote their part of the report in different files? Merge them all together into one final submission document — just make sure to add [page numbers](/en/tools/page-numbers) afterward so it flows smoothly.

### Accountants: Bundle receipts and invoices

Instead of a folder full of loose files, merge all your monthly receipts into a single PDF. It makes organized digital filing much easier.

## Tips for a better merged document

### Compress if the file gets too big

Combining multiple PDFs can result in a large file size. If it's too big to email, use the [Compress PDF](/en/tools/compress-pdf) tool to shrink it down without losing quality.

### Remove unwanted pages first

If one of your source files has blank pages or a cover sheet you don't need, use the [Delete Pages](/en/tools/delete-pages) tool to clean it up before merging.

### Get your order right

The order matters. Make sure to drag your files into the correct sequence *before* hitting the generic button. It's much easier than fixing it later with the [Organize PDF](/en/tools/organize-pdf) tool.
