You've spent an hour formatting a Word document — adjusting margins, choosing fonts, making everything look just right. Then you email it to someone, they open it in a different version of Word, and the layout is completely different. Frustrating, right?

Converting your Word file to PDF solves this problem once and for all. PDFs look the same on every device, every screen, and every printer. Here's how to convert in both directions, for free.

## How to convert Word to PDF

Use the free [Word to PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/word-to-pdf) tool to create a perfectly formatted PDF from your Word document.

1. Go to the [Word to PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/word-to-pdf) tool.
2. Upload your Word file (.doc or .docx).
3. Click **Convert**.
4. Download your PDF — ready to share, print, or archive.

Your fonts, images, headers, and page layout will look exactly the same in the PDF as they do in Word. No surprises.

## How to convert PDF to Word

Need to go the other direction? Sometimes you receive a PDF but need to make edits to the text. Use the [PDF to Word](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-docx) tool to create an editable document.

1. Go to the [PDF to Word](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-docx) tool.
2. Upload the PDF you want to edit.
3. Click **Convert**.
4. Download your Word file and start making changes.

The conversion does its best to preserve the original layout, making it as close to the PDF as possible. For more details, check out our full guide on [how to convert PDF to Word](/en/blog/how-to-convert-pdf-to-word).

## Real-world ways people use these tools

### Students: Submit assignments professionally

Most universities require submissions in PDF format. Convert your Word essays, research papers, and reports to PDF before uploading, and know that your professor will see exactly what you intended.

### Professionals: Lock documents for sharing

Sending proposals, contracts, or reports? Convert to PDF so recipients can't accidentally (or intentionally) change the content. The formatting stays consistent regardless of what software they use.

### Freelancers: Edit client PDFs

A client sends you a PDF that needs copy changes. Instead of asking for the original Word file, convert the PDF to Word, make your edits, and send it back.

## Tips for better results

### Check fonts before converting

If your Word document uses unusual fonts, the PDF conversion should embed them automatically. But if something looks off, try using widely available fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri.

### Handle scanned PDFs with OCR

If the PDF you're converting to Word is a scanned document (images of text, not actual selectable text), the plain conversion won't extract the text. Use [OCR](/en/tools/ocr-pdf) first to make the text recognizable, then convert to Word.

### Compress large files

Word documents with lots of high-resolution images can produce large PDFs. After converting, use the [Compress PDF](/en/tools/compress-pdf) tool to reduce the file size for easier sharing. Our [PDF compression guide](/en/blog/how-to-compress-pdf-files) has more tips.
