## How to convert PNG to PDF

Use the free [PNG to PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/png-to-pdf) tool to combine your images into a clean PDF.

1. Go to the [PNG to PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/png-to-pdf) tool.
2. Upload one or more PNG images.
3. Arrange the images in the order you want them to appear.
4. Adjust page size and orientation if needed.
5. Click **Convert**.
6. Download your new PDF.

Each PNG becomes its own page in the PDF. Perfect for turning screenshots, diagrams, or design mockups into a shareable document.

## How to convert PDF to PNG

Need to go the other way? Use the [PDF to PNG](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-png) tool.

1. Go to the [PDF to PNG](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-png) tool.
2. Upload the PDF you want to convert.
3. Choose to convert all pages or select specific ones.
4. Click **Convert**.
5. Download your PNG images — individually or as a ZIP.

PNG is a great choice when you need sharp, lossless images — especially for text-heavy pages, screenshots, or documents with fine lines and diagrams.

## Why PNG? When to choose it over JPG

Both are image formats, but they serve different purposes:

**Choose PNG when** you need pixel-perfect quality — screenshots, UI mockups, documents with text, charts, or logos. PNG is lossless, so there are no compression artifacts around text edges.

**Choose JPG when** file size matters more than crispness — photos, colorful images, or attachments where smaller files are preferred. You can use the [PDF to JPG](/en/tools/pdf-to-jpg) tool for that.

For most document conversions, PNG gives you the sharpest results.

## Real-world ways people use PNG and PDF conversion

### Designers: Share mockups as documents

You've created a series of UI screenshots or wireframe PNGs. Package them into a single PDF to share with your client — organized, paginated, and easy to review.

### Teachers: Create handouts from screenshots

Captured step-by-step instructions as screenshots? Convert them to a PDF handout that students can follow along with.

### Professionals: Pull pages from reports for presentations

Need a single chart from a 30-page report for your slide deck? Convert just that page to PNG and insert it into your presentation — crisp and clean.

## Tips for better results

### Mixed image formats? No problem

If you have a mix of PNG, JPG, and other formats, use the [Image to PDF](/en/tools/image-to-pdf) tool. It accepts all common image formats and combines them into one PDF.

### Compress after converting

If your PNGs are high-resolution, the resulting PDF can be large. Use [Compress PDF](/en/tools/compress-pdf) to reduce the file size without visible quality loss.

### Need searchable text?

After converting PNGs of text to PDF, the document contains images — not selectable text. If you need to search or copy text, run [OCR](/en/tools/ocr-pdf) on the converted PDF. Read our [OCR guide](/en/blog/pdf-ocr-make-scanned-pdfs-searchable) for more details.
