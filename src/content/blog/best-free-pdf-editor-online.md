## What can you do with an online editor?

### Fill out forms

Even if a PDF doesn't have interactive form fields, you can use the Text tool to type your answers directly onto the page. Positioning is easy — just drag the text box where you need it.

### Sign documents

Need to sign a contract or permission slip? Use the Draw tool to create your signature with your mouse or touchscreen, then place it on the signature line.

### Annotate and review

Reviewing a draft for a colleague? Use the Highlight and Comment tools to mark up changes, ask questions, or draw attention to specific sections.

### Add images and logos

Insert your company logo into a header, or add a photo to a report. You can resize and move images freely within the document.

## Real-world ways people use this tool

### Students: Take notes on slides

Download your professor's lecture slides as a PDF, then use the editor to type notes directly onto the slides or highlight key concepts during class.

### Freelancers: Customize invoices

Download a generic invoice template, then use the editor to add your logo, business details, and client information before saving and sending it.

### HR Managers: fast paperwork

Received a signed document that's missing a date or a checkbox? Instead of sending it back, make the quick fix yourself in seconds.

## Tips for better editing

### Match the font

When adding new text, try to match the font and size of the original document. The editor offers standard fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier that blend in well.

### Zoom in for precision

Need to place a checkmark in a tiny box? Zoom in to 200% to position it perfectly, then zoom out to check the whole page.

### Use layers

The editor handles text and images as separate layers. You can move them front or back to prevent them from covering up important content.
