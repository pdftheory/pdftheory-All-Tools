You have a scanned contract, a photographed receipt, or pages from a book saved as a PDF. It looks like text, but when you try to search for a word or copy a sentence... nothing happens. You can't select anything. That's because scanned PDFs are just images of text — not actual text your computer can read.

OCR fixes this. It scans the image, recognizes the characters, and adds a searchable text layer to your PDF. Your document looks the same, but now every word is selectable, searchable, and copy-pasteable.

> ## Key Takeaways
> 
> - OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition — it turns images of text into actual, selectable text.
> - Your scanned PDF will look exactly the same, but with a hidden searchable text layer added.
> - After OCR, you can search, copy, and convert your document to Word or Excel.
> - Works directly in your browser — no software to install, no account required.
> - Supports dozens of languages for accurate text recognition.

## Signs you need OCR

Not sure if your PDF needs OCR? Here are a few telltale signs:

- You can't highlight or select any text in the document.
- Ctrl+F (Find) doesn't find anything, even for words you can clearly see.
- The PDF was created by scanning a physical document or taking a photo.
- Copy and paste produces nothing — or garbled characters.

If any of these sound familiar, OCR is exactly what you need.

## How to OCR a PDF with PDFTheory

Use the free [OCR PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/ocr-pdf) tool to make your scanned documents searchable.

1. Go to the [OCR PDF](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/ocr-pdf) tool.
2. Upload the scanned PDF you want to process.
3. Select the language(s) in the document.
4. Click **OCR**.
5. Download your newly searchable PDF.

That's it. Your document looks identical, but now you can search for any word, highlight passages, and copy text.

## What you can do after OCR

OCR is powerful on its own, but it really shines when combined with other tools:

### Convert to Word

After OCR processing, use [PDF to Word](/en/tools/pdf-to-docx) to turn the scanned document into a fully editable Word file. This is the best way to recover editable text from paper documents. Check out our [PDF to Word guide](/en/blog/how-to-convert-pdf-to-word) for details.

### Convert to Excel

Have scanned invoices or financial statements? Run OCR, then use [PDF to Excel](/en/tools/pdf-to-xlsx) to extract the data into a spreadsheet for analysis.

### Compress

Scanned documents are often large because they're essentially images. After OCR, use [Compress PDF](/en/tools/compress-pdf) to reduce the file size while keeping the searchable text layer intact.

### Merge

After OCR-processing multiple scanned documents, use [Merge PDF](/en/tools/merge-pdf) to combine them into a single, fully searchable archive.

## Real-world ways people use OCR

### Students: Digitize lecture notes

Photographed your professor's handwritten notes or scanned printed handouts? OCR makes them searchable so you can find specific topics instantly when studying for exams.

### Professionals: Archive paper documents

Scanning old contracts, records, or reports? OCR transforms them from static images into fully searchable digital documents. Find any clause or figure in seconds instead of scrolling through hundreds of pages.

### Small business owners: Process receipts and invoices

Scan or photograph paper receipts, run OCR, and then you can search, sort, and export the data. It makes bookkeeping and tax time much more manageable.

## Tips for better OCR results

### Scan quality makes a big difference

The clearer the original scan, the more accurate the OCR output. Aim for at least 300 DPI, good contrast between text and background, and straight, non-skewed pages.

### Choose the right language

Always select the correct language(s) for your document. OCR uses language-specific models, and selecting the wrong one can produce garbled text.

### Review the output

OCR is very accurate with printed text, but it's not perfect. Watch for common misrecognitions like "l" vs "1", "O" vs "0", or unusual characters. A quick review after processing catches most issues.
