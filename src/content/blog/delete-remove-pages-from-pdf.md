You've got a 20-page PDF, but pages 1, 2, and 18 are just filler — a cover page, a blank page, and an ad at the end. You don't want to share those. Or maybe you've scanned a stack of documents and a few blank pages slipped through. Whatever the reason, deleting pages from a PDF should be quick and easy.

## How to delete pages from a PDF

Use the free [Delete Pages](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/delete-pages) tool to remove any pages you don't need.

1. Go to the [Delete Pages](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/delete-pages) tool.
2. Upload the PDF you want to edit.
3. Select the pages you want to remove — click on the thumbnails or enter page numbers.
4. Click **Delete**.
5. Download your updated PDF with the unwanted pages gone.

The remaining pages are automatically re-ordered and saved into a clean, final document.

## Remove blank pages automatically

If your issue is blank pages sneaking into scanned documents or merged files, there's a faster way. The [Remove Blank Pages](/en/tools/remove-blank-pages) tool automatically detects and removes empty pages without you having to find them manually.

This is especially helpful when you've scanned a double-sided document and the backs of some pages came through blank, or when a merge brought in unintended empty pages.

## Real-world ways people use page deletion

### Students: Clean up scanned notes

After scanning handwritten notes, blank or blurry pages often end up in the mix. Delete them before sharing with classmates or uploading to your course portal.

### Professionals: Remove confidential sections

Before sharing a report externally, remove any internal-only pages like draft notes, financial appendices, or internal comments. Keep the document focused and professional.

### Small business owners: Trim marketing materials

Update your product catalog by removing pages for discontinued items, or strip the cover from a proposal before including the content in a larger document.

## Going further: organize and rearrange pages

Deleting pages is just one part of managing your PDF structure. Here are a few related tools that work well together:

### Rearrange page order

Need to move pages around instead of deleting them? Use the [Organize PDF](/en/tools/organize-pdf) tool to drag and drop pages into any order you like.

### Add pages from another document

Want to insert pages from a different PDF? Use the [Merge PDF](/en/tools/merge-pdf) tool to combine documents, then organize the result. Our [merge guide](/en/blog/how-to-merge-pdf-files-online) walks through it step by step.

### Split into separate files

Instead of deleting pages, sometimes it makes more sense to split the PDF into multiple smaller files. The [Split PDF](/en/tools/split-pdf) tool handles this perfectly — read more in our [splitting guide](/en/blog/how-to-split-pdf-files).
