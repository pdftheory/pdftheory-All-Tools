## How to convert PDF to JPG

Use the free [PDF to JPG](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-jpg) tool to turn your PDF pages into images.

1. Go to the [PDF to JPG](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/pdf-to-jpg) tool.
2. Upload the PDF file you want to convert.
3. Choose whether to convert all pages or select specific ones.
4. Click **Convert**.
5. Download your JPG images individually or as a ZIP file.

Each page becomes its own JPG image. The whole process takes a few seconds.

## When to use JPG vs PNG

Both formats work well for different situations:

**Choose JPG when** you need smaller file sizes — for example, when attaching images to emails, uploading to websites, or sharing on social media. JPG handles photos and colorful pages especially well.

**Choose PNG when** you need crisp text and sharp edges — for example, screenshots, diagrams, or documents with fine lines. PNG files are larger but lossless. You can use the [PDF to PNG](/en/tools/pdf-to-png) tool for that.

Not sure which to pick? For most everyday tasks, JPG is the way to go.

## Real-world ways people use PDF to JPG

### Students: Create presentation visuals

Pull charts, diagrams, or illustrations from your textbook PDFs and drop them right into your slides. No need to screenshot or crop — just convert the exact page you need.

### Professionals: Share documents as images

Sometimes the easiest way to share a document with a colleague is as an image — especially in messaging apps or project management tools that preview images but not PDFs.

### Content creators: Repurpose PDF content

Turn infographic PDFs, flyer designs, or report pages into images you can post on Instagram, LinkedIn, or your website without any extra design work.

## Tips for the best results

### Pick the right pages

If you only need a few pages, select just those instead of converting the entire document. It saves time and gives you exactly what you need without extra files to sort through.

### Compress large images if needed

High-resolution PDFs can produce large JPG files. If file size matters — for email attachments or web uploads — consider using an image compression tool after converting.

### Need to go the other way?

If you have JPG images you want to turn back into a PDF, use the [JPG to PDF](/en/tools/jpg-to-pdf) tool. You can also read our full guide on [converting JPG to PDF](/en/blog/convert-jpg-to-pdf-online-free) for step-by-step instructions.
