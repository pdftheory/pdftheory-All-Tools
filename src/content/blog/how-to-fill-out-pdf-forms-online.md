You receive a PDF form by email — maybe an application, a tax document, or a medical intake form. The old way? Print it, fill it in by hand, scan it, and send it back. That's a lot of effort for a few text fields. The better way? Fill it out directly on your screen, save it, and send it back in minutes.

Here's how to fill out any PDF form online using PDFTheory — no printing, no scanning, no hassle.

## How to fill out a PDF form online

Use the free [Form Filler](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/form-filler) tool to complete your PDF forms in seconds.

1. Go to the [Form Filler](https://pdftheory.com/en/tools/form-filler) tool.
2. Upload the PDF form you need to fill out.
3. Click on any field and start typing. Add checkmarks, dates, or text wherever needed.
4. Add your signature if the form requires one.
5. Click **Apply** to save your changes.
6. Download the completed PDF — ready to send.

That's it. No printer, no scanner, no paper.

## Interactive forms vs flat forms

PDF forms come in two types, and it helps to know the difference:

**Interactive forms** have clickable fields — you can tap a text box and start typing. These are the easiest to fill out because the fields are pre-defined.

**Flat forms** look like forms but don't have clickable fields. They're basically images or printed layouts saved as PDFs. With PDFTheory's Form Filler, you can still fill these out by placing text directly on top of the form, positioning it exactly where you need it.

Either way, you're covered.

## Real-world ways people use this tool

### Job seekers: Complete application forms fast

Many employers still send PDF application forms. Instead of printing and handwriting your answers, fill them out digitally for a cleaner, more professional result.

### Patients: Save time at the doctor's office

Got medical intake forms emailed to you before an appointment? Fill them out on your phone or laptop before you arrive, and save yourself the clipboard-and-pen routine in the waiting room.

### Small business owners: Handle paperwork digitally

Vendor agreements, tax forms, license applications — there's always something to sign and send back. Doing it all digitally means you keep clean copies and skip the scanner entirely.

## Tips for better results

### Look for interactive fields first

If a form has interactive fields, the Form Filler will detect them automatically. Just click and type. If it doesn't seem to have them, switch to placing text manually — it works just as well.

### Use the zoom function for small fields

Some forms have tiny fields for things like phone numbers or dates. Zoom in to make sure your text is positioned accurately within the lines.

### Need more editing options?

If you need to do more than fill in fields — like adding images, shapes, or extensive annotations — try the full [Edit PDF](/en/tools/edit-pdf) tool instead.
